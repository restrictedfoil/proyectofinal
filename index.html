         <h3 class="info">One of the more fascinating artistic evolutions since the late 2000s has been that of Tyler, The Creator. The rapper and producer surfaced as a founding member of , an outlandish alternative rap crew that gradually permeated the mainstream as it begat a multitude of related projects. A high percentage of these recordings, including 's Earl (2010), 's The OF Tape, Vol. 2 (2012), and 's Grammy-winning Channel Orange (2012), have been made with Tyler's deep involvement. As a solo artist, Tyler's output has gleefully swung from purposefully distasteful and crude to charming and sophisticated, sometimes blurring the distinction between the extremes. His first four solo albums, namely Goblin (2011), Wolf (2013), Cherry Bomb (2015), and Flower Boy (2017), debuted within the Top Five of the Billboard 200, distinguished above all other unique qualities by his gravelly voice and an irascible disposition befitting a collision-shop owner. The widespread embrace of the kaleidoscopic Flower Boy, a number two hit nominated for a Grammy in the category of Best Rap Album, has led to a pair of subsequent number one albums: IGOR (2019), another Grammy-nominated recording, and CALL ME IF YOU GET LOST (2021), which expanded the artist's stylistic reach while reaffirming his devotion to hip-hop with a raw lyrical approach.</h3>
